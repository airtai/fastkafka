# Deploy FastKafka docs to GitHub Pages

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Getting started

Add your workflow file `.github/workflows/fastkafka_docs_deploy.yml` and
push it to your remote default branch.

Here is an example workflow:

``` yaml
name: Deploy FastKafka Generated Documentation to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main", "master" ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: airtai/workflows/fastkafka-ghp@main
        with:
          app: "test_fastkafka.application:kafka_app"
```

## Options

### Set app location

Input in the form of `path:app`, where `path` is the path to a Python
file and `app` is an object of type `FastKafka`:

``` yaml
- name: Deploy
  uses: airtai/workflows/fastkafka-ghp@main
  with:
    app: "test_fastkafka.application:kafka_app"
```

In the above example, `FastKafka` app is named as `kafka_app` and it is
available in the `application` submodule of the `test_fastkafka` module.

## Example Repository

A `FastKafka`-based library that uses the above-mentioned workfow
actions to publish FastKafka docs to `Github Pages` can be found
[here](https://github.com/airtai/sample_fastkafka_project/blob/main/.github/workflows/fastkafka_deploy.yaml).
