# @consumes basics

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

You can use `@consumes` decorator to consume messages from Kafka topics.

In this guide we will create a simple FastKafka app that will consume
`HelloWorld` messages from hello_world topic.

## Import [`FastKafka`](../api/fastkafka/FastKafka.md/#fastkafka.FastKafka)

To use the `@consumes` decorator, first we need to import the base
FastKafka app to create our application.

``` python
from fastkafka import FastKafka
```

In this demo we will log the messages to the output so that we can
inspect and verify that our app is consuming properly. For that we need
to import the logger.

``` python
from fastkafka._components.logger import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)
```

## Define the structure of the messages

Next, you need to define the structure of the messages you want to
consume from the topic using [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/). For
the guide we’ll stick to something basic, but you are free to define any
complex message structure you wish in your project, just make sure it
can be JSON encoded.

Let’s import `BaseModel` and `Field` from pydantic and create a simple
`HelloWorld` class containing one string parameter `msg`

``` python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
```

``` python

class HelloWorld(BaseModel):
    msg: str = Field(
        ...,
        example="Hello",
        description="Demo hello world message",
    )
```

## Create a base FastKafka app

Now we will create and define a base FastKafka app, replace the
`<url_of_your_kafka_bootstrap_server>` and
`<port_of_your_kafka_bootstrap_server>` with the actual values of your
Kafka bootstrap server

``` python


kafka_brokers = {
    "demo_broker": {
        "url": "<url_of_your_kafka_bootstrap_server>",
        "description": "local demo kafka broker",
        "port": "<port_of_your_kafka_bootstrap_server>",
    }
}

app = FastKafka(kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers)
```

## Create a consumer function and decorate it with `@consumes`

Let’s create a consumer function that will consume `HelloWorld` messages
from *hello_world* topic and log them.

``` python
@app.consumes()
async def on_hello_world(msg: HelloWorld):
    logger.info(f"Got msg: {msg}")
```

The function decorated with the `@consumes` decorator will be called
when a message is produced to Kafka.

The message will then be injected into the typed *msg* argument of the
function and its type will be used to parse the message.

In this example case, when the message is sent into a *hello_world*
topic, it will be parsed into a HelloWorld class and `on_hello_world`
function will be called with the parsed class as *msg* argument value.

## Final app

Your app code should look like this:

``` python
from fastkafka import FastKafka
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from fastkafka._components.logger import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)

class HelloWorld(BaseModel):
    msg: str = Field(
        ...,
        example="Hello",
        description="Demo hello world message",
    )


kafka_brokers = {
    "demo_broker": {
        "url": "<url_of_your_kafka_bootstrap_server>",
        "description": "local demo kafka broker",
        "port": "<port_of_your_kafka_bootstrap_server>",
    }
}

app = FastKafka(kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers)
@app.consumes()
async def on_hello_world(msg: HelloWorld):
    logger.info(f"Got msg: {msg}")
```

## Run the app

Now we can run the app. Copy the code above in consumer_example.py and
run it by running

``` shell
fastkafka run --num-workers=1 --kafka-broker=demo_broker consumer_example:app
```

After running the command, you should see this output in your terminal:

    [513863]: [INFO] fastkafka._application.app: set_kafka_broker() : Setting bootstrap_servers value to '127.0.0.1:9092'
    [513863]: [INFO] fastkafka._components.aiokafka_consumer_loop: aiokafka_consumer_loop() starting...

    [513863]: [INFO] fastkafka._components.aiokafka_consumer_loop: aiokafka_consumer_loop(): Consumer stopped.

    [INFO] fastkafka._server: terminate_asyncio_process(): Process 513863 terminated.

## Send the message to kafka topic

Lets send a `HelloWorld` message to the *hello_world* topic and check if
our consumer kafka application has logged the received message. In your
terminal, run:

``` shell
echo {\"msg\": \"Hello world\"} | kafka-console-producer.sh --topic=hello_world --bootstrap-server=<addr_of_your_kafka_bootstrap_server>
```

``` python
print(consumer_task.value[1].decode("UTF-8"))
```

You should see the “Got msg: msg='Hello world'" being logged by your
consumer.

## Choosing a topic

You probably noticed that you didn’t define which topic you are
receiving the message from, this is because the `@consumes` decorator
determines the topic by default from your function name. The decorator
will take your function name and strip the default “on\_" prefix from it
and use the rest as the topic name. In this example case, the topic is
*hello_world*.

You can choose your custom prefix by defining the `prefix` parameter in
consumes decorator, like this:

Also, you can define the topic name completely by defining the `topic`
in parameter in consumes decorator, like this:

## Message data

The message received from kafka is translated from binary JSON
representation int the class defined by typing of *msg* parameter in the
function decorated by the `@consumes` decorator.

In this example case, the message will be parsed into a `HelloWorld`
class.

## Message metadata

If you need any of Kafka message metadata such as timestamp, partition
or headers you can access the metadata by adding a EventMetadata typed
argument to your consumes function and the metadata from the incoming
message will be automatically injected when calling the consumes
function.

Let’s demonstrate that.

### Create a consumer function with metadata

The only difference from the original basic consume function is that we
are now passing the `meta: EventMetadata` argument to the function. The
`@consumes` decorator will register that and, when a message is
consumed, it will also pass the metadata to your function. Now you can
use the metadata in your consume function. Lets log it to see what it
contains.

First, we need to import the EventMetadata

Now we can add the `meta` argument to our consuming function.

Your final app should look like this:

Now lets run the app and send a message to the broker to see the logged
message metadata.

You should see a similar log as the one below and the metadata being
logged in your app.

As you can see in the log, from the metadata you now have the
information about the partition, offset, timestamp, key and headers.
:tada:

## Dealing with high latency consuming functions

If your functions have high latency due to, for example, lengthy
database calls you will notice a big decrease in performance. This is
due to the issue of how the consumes decorator executes your consume
functions when consumeing events. By default, the consume function will
run the consuming funtions for one topic sequentially, this is the most
straightforward approach and results with the least amount of overhead.

But, to handle those high latency tasks and run them in parallel,
FastKafka has a
[`DynamicTaskExecutor`](../api/fastkafka/executors/DynamicTaskExecutor.md/#fastkafka.executors.DynamicTaskExecutor)
prepared for your consumers. This executor comes with additional
overhead, so use it only when you need to handle high latency functions.

Lets demonstrate how to use it.

``` python
decorate_consumes_executor = """@app.consumes(executor="DynamicTaskExecutor")
async def on_hello_world(msg: HelloWorld):
    logger.info(f"Got msg: {msg}")
"""
md(f"```python\n{decorate_consumes}\n```")
```

``` python
@app.consumes()
async def on_hello_world(msg: HelloWorld):
    logger.info(f"Got msg: {msg}")
```

Lets send a `HelloWorld` message to the *hello_world* topic and check if
our consumer kafka application has logged the received message. In your
terminal, run:

``` shell
echo {\"msg\": \"Hello world\"} | kafka-console-producer.sh --topic=hello_world --bootstrap-server=<addr_of_your_kafka_bootstrap_server>
```

You should see the “Got msg: msg='Hello world'" being logged by your
consumer.
