# Using multiple Kafka clusters

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Ready to take your FastKafka app to the next level? This guide shows you
how to connect to multiple Kafka clusters effortlessly. Consolidate
topics and produce messages across clusters like a pro. Unleash the full
potential of your Kafka-powered app with FastKafka. Let’s dive in and
elevate your application’s capabilities!

### Test message

To showcase the functionalities of FastKafka and illustrate the concepts
discussed, we can use a simple test message called `TestMsg`. Here’s the
definition of the `TestMsg` class:

``` python
class TestMsg(BaseModel):
    msg: str = Field(...)
```

## Defining multiple broker configurations

When building a FastKafka application, you may need to consume messages
from multiple Kafka clusters, each with its own set of broker
configurations. FastKafka provides the flexibility to define different
broker clusters using the brokers argument in the consumes decorator.
Let’s explore an example code snippet

``` python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from fastkafka import FastKafka

class TestMsg(BaseModel):
    msg: str = Field(...)

kafka_brokers_1 = dict(
    development=dict(url="dev.server_1", port=9092),
    production=dict(url="prod.server_1", port=9092),
)
kafka_brokers_2 = dict(
    development=dict(url="dev.server_2", port=9092),
    production=dict(url="prod.server_1", port=9092),
)

app = FastKafka(kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers_1)


@app.consumes(topic="preprocessed_signals")
async def on_preprocessed_signals_1(msg: TestMsg):
    print(f"Received on s1: {msg=}")
    await to_predictions_1(msg)


@app.consumes(topic="preprocessed_signals", brokers=kafka_brokers_2)
async def on_preprocessed_signals_2(msg: TestMsg):
    print(f"Received on s2: {msg=}")
    await to_predictions_2(msg)
    
@app.produces(topic="predictions")
async def to_predictions_1(msg: TestMsg) -> TestMsg:
    return msg
    
@app.produces(topic="predictions", brokers=kafka_brokers_2)
async def to_predictions_2(msg: TestMsg) -> TestMsg:
    return msg
```

In this example, the application has two consumes endpoints, both of
which will consume events from `preprocessed_signals` topic.
`on_preprocessed_signals_1` will consume events from `kafka_brokers_1`
configuration and `on_preprocessed_signals_2` will consume events from
`kafka_brokers_2` configuration. When producing, `to_predictions_1` will
produce to `predictions` topic on `kafka_brokers_1` cluster and
`to_predictions_2` will produce to `predictions` topic on
`kafka_brokers_2` cluster.

#### How it works

The `kafka_brokers_1` configuration represents the primary cluster,
while `kafka_brokers_2` serves as an alternative cluster specified in
the decorator.

Using the FastKafka class, the app object is initialized with the
primary broker configuration (`kafka_brokers_1`). By default, the
`@app.consumes` decorator without the brokers argument consumes messages
from the `preprocessed_signals` topic on `kafka_brokers_1`.

To consume messages from a different cluster, the `@app.consumes`
decorator includes the `brokers` argument. This allows explicit
specification of the broker cluster in the `on_preprocessed_signals_2`
function, enabling consumption from the same topic but using the
`kafka_brokers_2` configuration.

The brokers argument can also be used in the @app.produces decorator to
define multiple broker clusters for message production.

It’s important to ensure that all broker configurations have the same
required settings as the primary cluster to ensure consistent behavior.

## Testing the application

To test our FastKafka ‘mirroring’ application, we can use our testing
framework. Lets take a look how it’s done:

``` python
from fastkafka.testing import Tester

async with Tester(app) as tester:
    # Send TestMsg to topic/broker pair on_preprocessed_signals_1 is consuming from
    await tester.mirrors[app.on_preprocessed_signals_1](TestMsg(msg="signal_s1"))
    # Assert on_preprocessed_signals_1 consumed sent message
    await app.awaited_mocks.on_preprocessed_signals_1.assert_called_with(
        TestMsg(msg="signal_s1"), timeout=5
    )
    # Assert app has produced a prediction
    await tester.mirrors[app.to_predictions_1].assert_called_with(
        TestMsg(msg="signal_s1"), timeout=5
    )

    # Send TestMsg to topic/broker pair on_preprocessed_signals_2 is consuming from
    await tester.mirrors[app.on_preprocessed_signals_2](TestMsg(msg="signal_s2"))
    # Assert on_preprocessed_signals_2 consumed sent message
    await app.awaited_mocks.on_preprocessed_signals_2.assert_called_with(
        TestMsg(msg="signal_s2"), timeout=5
    )
    # Assert app has produced a prediction
    await tester.mirrors[app.to_predictions_2].assert_called_with(
        TestMsg(msg="signal_s2"), timeout=5
    )
```

The usage of the `tester.mirrors` dictionary allows specifying the
desired topic/broker combination for sending the test messages,
especially when working with multiple Kafka clusters. This ensures that
the data is sent to the appropriate topic/broker based on the consuming
function, and consumed from appropriate topic/broker based on the
producing function.

## Running the application

You can run your application using `fastkafka run` CLI command in the
same way that you would run a single cluster app.

To start your app, copy the code above in multi_cluster_example.py and
run it by running:

Now we can run the app. Copy the code above in multi_cluster_example.py,
adjust your server configurations, and run it by running

``` shell
fastkafka run --num-workers=1 --kafka-broker=development multi_cluster_example:app
```

In your app logs, you should see your app starting up and your two
consumer functions connecting to different kafka clusters.

implemented, but it is under development and you can expecti it soon!

## Examples on how to use multiple broker configurations

### Example \#1

In this section, we’ll explore how you can effectively forward topics
between different Kafka clusters, enabling seamless data synchronization
for your applications.

Imagine having two Kafka clusters, namely `kafka_brokers_1` and
`kafka_brokers_2`, each hosting its own set of topics and messages. Now,
if you want to forward a specific topic (in this case:
`preprocessed_signals`) from kafka_brokers_1 to kafka_brokers_2,
FastKafka provides an elegant solution.

Let’s examine the code snippet that configures our application for topic
forwarding:

``` python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from fastkafka import FastKafka

class TestMsg(BaseModel):
    msg: str = Field(...)

kafka_brokers_1 = dict(localhost=dict(url="server_1", port=9092))
kafka_brokers_2 = dict(localhost=dict(url="server_2", port=9092))

app = FastKafka(kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers_1)


@app.consumes(topic="preprocessed_signals")
async def on_preprocessed_signals_original(msg: TestMsg):
    await to_preprocessed_signals_forward(msg)


@app.produces(topic="preprocessed_signals", brokers=kafka_brokers_2)
async def to_preprocessed_signals_forward(data: TestMsg) -> TestMsg:
    return data
```

Here’s how it works: our FastKafka application is configured to consume
messages from `kafka_brokers_1` and process them in the
`on_preprocessed_signals_original` function. We want to forward these
messages to `kafka_brokers_2`. To achieve this, we define the
`to_preprocessed_signals_forward` function as a producer, seamlessly
producing the processed messages to the preprocessed_signals topic
within the `kafka_brokers_2` cluster.

#### Testing

To test our FastKafka forwarding application, we can use our testing
framework. Let’s take a look at the testing code snippet:

``` python
from fastkafka.testing import Tester

async with Tester(app) as tester:
    await tester.mirrors[app.on_preprocessed_signals_original](TestMsg(msg="signal"))
    await tester.mirrors[app.to_preprocessed_signals_forward].assert_called(timeout=5)
```

With the help of the **Tester** object, we can simulate and verify the
behavior of our FastKafka application. Here’s how it works:

1.  We create an instance of the **Tester** by passing in our *app*
    object, which represents our FastKafka application.

2.  Using the **tester.mirrors** dictionary, we can send a message to a
    specific Kafka broker and topic combination. In this case, we use
    `tester.mirrors[app.on_preprocessed_signals_original]` to send a
    TestMsg message with the content “signal" to the appropriate Kafka
    broker and topic.

3.  After sending the message, we can perform assertions on the mirrored
    function using
    `tester.mirrors[app.to_preprocessed_signals_forward].assert_called(timeout=5)`.
    This assertion ensures that the mirrored function has been called
    within a specified timeout period (in this case, 5 seconds).

### Example \#2

In this section, we’ll explore how you can effortlessly consume data
from multiple sources, process it, and aggregate the results into a
single topic on a specific cluster.

Imagine you have two Kafka clusters: **kafka_brokers_1** and
**kafka_brokers_2**, each hosting its own set of topics and messages.
Now, what if you want to consume data from both clusters, perform some
processing, and produce the results to a single topic on
**kafka_brokers_1**? FastKafka has got you covered!

Let’s take a look at the code snippet that configures our application
for aggregating multiple clusters:

``` python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from fastkafka import FastKafka

class TestMsg(BaseModel):
    msg: str = Field(...)

kafka_brokers_1 = dict(localhost=dict(url="server_1", port=9092))
kafka_brokers_2 = dict(localhost=dict(url="server_2", port=9092))

app = FastKafka(kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers_1)


@app.consumes(topic="preprocessed_signals")
async def on_preprocessed_signals_1(msg: TestMsg):
    print(f"Default: {msg=}")
    await to_predictions(msg)


@app.consumes(topic="preprocessed_signals", brokers=kafka_brokers_2)
async def on_preprocessed_signals_2(msg: TestMsg):
    print(f"Specified: {msg=}")
    await to_predictions(msg)


@app.produces(topic="predictions")
async def to_predictions(prediction: TestMsg) -> TestMsg:
    print(f"Sending prediction: {prediction}")
    return [prediction]
```

Here’s the idea: our FastKafka application is set to consume messages
from the topic “preprocessed_signals" on **kafka_brokers_1** cluster, as
well as from the same topic on **kafka_brokers_2** cluster. We have two
consuming functions, `on_preprocessed_signals_1` and
`on_preprocessed_signals_2`, that handle the messages from their
respective clusters. These functions perform any required processing, in
this case, just calling the to_predictions function.

The exciting part is that the to_predictions function acts as a
producer, sending the processed results to the “predictions" topic on
**kafka_brokers_1 cluster**. By doing so, we effectively aggregate the
data from multiple sources into a single topic on a specific cluster.

This approach enables you to consume data from multiple Kafka clusters,
process it, and produce the aggregated results to a designated topic.
Whether you’re generating predictions, performing aggregations, or any
other form of data processing, FastKafka empowers you to harness the
full potential of multiple clusters.

#### Testing

Let’s take a look at the testing code snippet:

``` python
from fastkafka.testing import Tester

async with Tester(app) as tester:
    await tester.mirrors[app.on_preprocessed_signals_1](TestMsg(msg="signal"))
    await tester.mirrors[app.on_preprocessed_signals_2](TestMsg(msg="signal"))
    await tester.on_predictions.assert_called(timeout=5)
```

Here’s how the code above works:

1.  Within an `async with` block, create an instance of the Tester by
    passing in your app object, representing your FastKafka application.

2.  Using the tester.mirrors dictionary, you can send messages to
    specific Kafka broker and topic combinations. In this case, we use
    `tester.mirrors[app.on_preprocessed_signals_1]` and
    `tester.mirrors[app.on_preprocessed_signals_2]` to send TestMsg
    messages with the content “signal" to the corresponding Kafka broker
    and topic combinations.

3.  After sending the messages, you can perform assertions on the
    **on_predictions** function using
    `tester.on_predictions.assert_called(timeout=5)`. This assertion
    ensures that the on_predictions function has been called within a
    specified timeout period (in this case, 5 seconds).

### Example \#3

In some scenarios, you may need to produce messages to multiple Kafka
clusters simultaneously. FastKafka simplifies this process by allowing
you to configure your application to produce messages to multiple
clusters effortlessly. Let’s explore how you can achieve this:

Consider the following code snippet that demonstrates producing messages
to multiple clusters:

``` python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from fastkafka import FastKafka

class TestMsg(BaseModel):
    msg: str = Field(...)

kafka_brokers_1 = dict(localhost=dict(url="server_1", port=9092))
kafka_brokers_2 = dict(localhost=dict(url="server_2", port=9092))

app = FastKafka(kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers_1)


@app.consumes(topic="preprocessed_signals")
async def on_preprocessed_signals(msg: TestMsg):
    print(f"{msg=}")
    await to_predictions_1(TestMsg(msg="prediction"))
    await to_predictions_2(TestMsg(msg="prediction"))


@app.produces(topic="predictions")
async def to_predictions_1(prediction: TestMsg) -> TestMsg:
    print(f"Sending prediction to s1: {prediction}")
    return [prediction]


@app.produces(topic="predictions", brokers=kafka_brokers_2)
async def to_predictions_2(prediction: TestMsg) -> TestMsg:
    print(f"Sending prediction to s2: {prediction}")
    return [prediction]
```

Here’s what you need to know about producing to multiple clusters:

1.  We define two Kafka broker configurations: **kafka_brokers_1** and
    **kafka_brokers_2**, representing different clusters with their
    respective connection details.

2.  We create an instance of the FastKafka application, specifying
    **kafka_brokers_1** as the primary cluster for producing messages.

3.  The `on_preprocessed_signals` function serves as a consumer,
    handling incoming messages from the “preprocessed_signals" topic.
    Within this function, we invoke two producer functions:
    `to_predictions_1` and `to_predictions_2`.

4.  The `to_predictions_1` function sends predictions to the
    “predictions" topic on *kafka_brokers_1* cluster.

5.  Additionally, the `to_predictions_2` function sends the same
    predictions to the “predictions" topic on *kafka_brokers_2* cluster.
    This allows for producing the same data to multiple clusters
    simultaneously.

By utilizing this approach, you can seamlessly produce messages to
multiple Kafka clusters, enabling you to distribute data across
different environments or leverage the strengths of various clusters.

Feel free to customize the producer functions as per your requirements,
performing any necessary data transformations or enrichment before
sending the predictions.

With FastKafka, producing to multiple clusters becomes a breeze,
empowering you to harness the capabilities of multiple environments
effortlessly.

``` python

async with Tester(app) as tester:
    await tester.to_preprocessed_signals(TestMsg(msg="signal"))

    await tester.mirrors[to_predictions_2].assert_called(timeout=5)
```

Here’s how you can perform the necessary tests:

1.  Within an async with block, create an instance of the **Tester** by
    passing in your app object, representing your FastKafka application.

2.  Using the `tester.to_preprocessed_signals` method, you can send a
    TestMsg message with the content “signal".

3.  After sending the message, you can perform assertions on the
    to_predictions_1 and to_predictions_2 functions using
    `tester.mirrors[to_predictions_1].assert_called(timeout=5)` and
    `tester.mirrors[to_predictions_2].assert_called(timeout=5)`. These
    assertions ensure that the respective producer functions have
    produced data to their respective topic/broker combinations.

By employing this testing approach, you can verify that the producing
functions correctly send messages to their respective clusters. The
testing framework provided by FastKafka enables you to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of your application’s producing logic.
